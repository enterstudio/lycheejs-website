# Introduction

This set of tutorials will help you to understand the
underlying concepts of lychee.js and how to build Apps
with the engine.


## Prerequisites

You should have successfully installed lychee.js already.
If you haven't installed lychee.js on your development machine,
you can follow the instructions at the [Bundles](#!bundles)
section on the left.


## Overview

All tutorials have a `Download` available that contains the
finished project after following through the tutorial.

We recommend to go through each tutorial starting from the
top, because each tutorial teaches you essential knowledge
that is necessary across the lychee.js stack.

Each tutorial will cover only one specific area that is
automated by the engine already. When you're done with
the tutorials you have a complete isomorphic peer-to-peer
software bot that learns in its own AI cloud.


Every project in this tutorial has to be created within the
lychee.js `/projects` folder, so that the projects are harvested
correctly and can be managed by the `lycheejs-ranger`.

The installation folder is on all UNIX sytems `/opt/lycheejs`.


## Cheat Sheet

All the lychee.js software bots and their commands can be
confusing when you're not used to them. That's why we also
offer a Cheat Sheet in the [Media](#!media) section.
